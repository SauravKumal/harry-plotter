Release 1.1.5 is a small feature/bugfix release

   * Later, I will improve this to factor in its current progress compared to its average progress.
* Fix bug where clicking cancel was not clearing the selected job making it impossible to create new jobs with the save button
* Fix bug where having an old chia version installed caused a "Failed to Launch JVM error"
* Fix bug where program was crashing if it couldn't automatically find chia executable
* Provide linux install instructions
* Log plot job outputs to ~/.harryplotter and reattach to currently running jobs from old plotter instances
